### Hi there!

The story of our team starts through our shared passion for Open Science and Open Source Hardware, which brought us together in different work collaborations and eventually to the creation of Open Hardware Makers. 


We belive we can contribute to the dissemination and improvement of Open Source Hardware and its community via this program, which aims to share and teach best practices for building, documenting  and contributing to hardware projects. 

<br>

Coming from different countries and continents, with different backgrounds and being part of a diverse range of networks, we have been learning a lot from each other and hoping that this will make this program welcoming to a diverse and positive community.

As a project run by and for the community, we are always keen to hear from people interested in joining our team! please send us an [email](mailto:ohwmakers@gmail.com) and let's get chatting!
