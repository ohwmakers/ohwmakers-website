# Thermal sensor for intradomiciliary thermal monitoring in localities without reports of the presence of aedes aegypti

This project seeks to determine the indoor thermal conditions of homes in localities without the presence of the aedes aegypti vector. Through the Internet of Things (IoT) in an accessible, operational and innovative way, we seek to better understand the environmental determinants that could limit Aedes infestation.
