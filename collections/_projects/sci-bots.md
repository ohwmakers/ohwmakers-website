# Sci-Bots

We develop next generation tools to automate and miniaturize biology and chemistry. Our portable and easy-to-use DropBot platform uses digital microfluidics to transform lab experiments into software instructions that can be optimized, shared to the cloud, and replicated anywhere in the world with perfect fidelity.
