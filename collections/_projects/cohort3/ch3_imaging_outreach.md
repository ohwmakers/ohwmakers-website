# Imaging outreach activity



About the project: Have you ever wondered how images and light travel through the camera or a magnifying glass? This project aims to provide instructions for you to set your own experiment or outreach activity to explore this physical phenomenon. Learn the difference between creating a real image or observing virtual images and how convex lenses work using a magnifying glass.
