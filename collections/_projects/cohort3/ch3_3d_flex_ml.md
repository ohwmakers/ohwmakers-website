# 3DFlexML



**3DFlexML** is an open-source platform that integrates 3D-printed flexible conductive sensors with TinyML to create adaptable, real-time sensing solutions. It enables users to print sensors in any form and train embedded machine learning models to interpret touch, bend, and pressure inputs, making it ideal for applications in wearables, robotics, human-computer interaction, and industrial automation.

Meet GRU, the first 3D printer that can keep printing when it runs out of Z-travel by climbing further up!
Our goal is to create a 3D printing system without build volume limitation and this I the first proof of concept for a much lager project.
You can find all the resources to create your own at https://github.com/itsameWolf/gru-scaffold although I wouldnâ€™t recommend it just yet, unless you are ready to tinker and fiddle with it!
