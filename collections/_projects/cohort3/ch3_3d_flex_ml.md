# 3DFlexML



**3DFlexML** is an open-source platform that integrates 3D-printed flexible conductive sensors with TinyML to create adaptable, real-time sensing solutions. It enables users to print sensors in any form and train embedded machine learning models to interpret touch, bend, and pressure inputs, making it ideal for applications in wearables, robotics, human-computer interaction, and industrial automation.
