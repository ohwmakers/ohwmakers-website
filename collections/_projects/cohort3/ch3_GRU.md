# GRU



Meet **GRU**, the first 3D printer that can keep printing when it runs out of Z-travel by climbing further up!
Our goal is to create a 3D printing system without build volume limitation and this I the first proof of concept for a much lager project.

You can find all the resources to create your own at https://github.com/itsameWolf/gru-scaffold although I wouldnâ€™t recommend it just yet, unless you are ready to tinker and fiddle with it!
