# Chigubhu Lantern 

Making led lanterns reusing electronic waste, then reusing plastic water bottles (Chigubhu in shona) as housing for the lantern: the goal of this project is to ensure 'A light for every student' across Africa were many students do not have access to high quality and reliable lighting.
