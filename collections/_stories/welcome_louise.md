We are extremely happy and grateful to announce that Dr. [Louise Bezuidenhout](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louise-bezuidenhout-4b448517/) has joined Open Hardware Makers as part of the organisation team! 

Louise has a recognised trajectory within the Open Hardware community, and has participated in Open Hardware Makers as a mentor during cohort 1. Her experience organising Open hardware hackathons and workshops with different communities around the world is incredibly useful for our team moving forward. 

Louise brings significant theoretical as well as practical skills to the team. Currently working as a Data expert and Open Science advocate at the Data Archiving and Networked Services in the Netherlands, Louise is already supporting the organisation of  cohort 2 (applications for this cohort are open!).

We are really happy to welcome Louise into the team, looking forward to growing Open Hardware Makers together :)
