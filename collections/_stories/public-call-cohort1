## Celebrating OHM Cohort 1 ðŸŽ‰

Open Hardware Makersâ€™ first cohort of 2022 is coming to an end. We are extremely proud of the projects and developer teams that took part in the program, learning and applying best practices on Open source hardware for the last 4 months. 

Join us in celebrating the work of our mentees at the Open Hardware Makers public call! The call will open with an introduction from a guest speaker, followed by 3' demos from our mentees. You will have the chance of meeting the projects, ask questions and engage with the broader community.
