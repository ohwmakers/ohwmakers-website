Graduation Call & Public Demos: Join us!

The second cohort of Open Hardware Makers programme (Science Edition!) is coming to an end. The next cohort call, next Wednesday, December 7 4 PM UTC,  is the last one, Graduation Call! And therefore, it will be different: an open call, as a real graduation ceremony. 


We will have a very special guest: [Dr. Cecilia Herbert](https://ceci.herbert.com.ar/), from [Open Ephys](https://open-ephys.org/), a company selling open source hardware for Neurosciences, who will speak about how to take open practices to produce and sell open science hardware.
After Dr. Herbertâ€™s talk, it will be Public Demo time! The eight teams of mentees will show how they have leveraged their open science hardware projects with the help of OHM mentors and experts. There are very diverse projects, related to health, education, microbiology, epidemiology and even architecture!
You are invited to join the party on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/ti74qaau77E)! See you there next Wednesday, 4 PM UTC.
