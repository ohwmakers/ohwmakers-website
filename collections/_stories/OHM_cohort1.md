Dear Open Source Hardware community, friends, enthusiasts and allies,

After a long incubation period, we are very happy to announce that **Open Hardware Makers (OHM) is ready to open its first 2022 cohort**!

### What is OHM in a nutshell

OHM is a mentorship program for open source hardware projects and their developers. Selected applicants learn the best practices for building reusable, inclusive and sustainable open projects, supported by 1-to-1 mentorship and a vibrant community of experts and peers.

### How does OHM work?

Open Hardware Makers is organized in 16-weeks cohorts; during this time participants go through 8 hands-on modules, each taking 2 weeks to complete. The complete Open Hardware Makers Curriculum can be found [here](https://curriculum.openhardware.space).   

At the beginning of the cohort each participant is matched with a mentor, who supports their journey through the program with bi-weekly check-ins. Every other week, participants interact with each other in "cohort calls". These calls are an opportunity to discuss challenges, ideas and experiences from the current module they are working on, with peers. Mid-program, projects are assessed by a group of experts in the specific application domain, who provide feedback and opportunities for improvement.

Participants are expected to present a demo of their projects by the end of the program, showcasing their learnings. To prepare for this call, OHM organizes a global online sprint that fosters collaboration on their projects and support from our wider open hardware community.

### Why apply to OHM?

Building open hardware projects is exciting, but making them reusable, inclusive and sustainable takes quite some effort. There are lots of resources online for learning how to build stuff, but how do you ensure your project is making a contribution to the community? How do you design your project so others can find it, contribute to it, and make it grow?

Open Hardware Makers is designed to address this gap. We connect you with a global community of mentors who will guide you through this process, experts who will assess your opportunities for improvement, and peers to share your learnings along the way. Our curriculum was put together based on a wide consultation with members of the Open Source Hardware community, to ensure we are reflecting the best practices from work in real life.   

### Who can apply, and how?

Applicants can be individuals or teams who are already running or starting an open hardware project. Successful applicants are willing to design and develop open hardware projects that empower others to collaborate within inclusive communities. They are passionate about openness and are ready to learn and apply open hardware best practices to their projects while supporting the global open hardware movement.

To apply to OHM therefore you need to be involved in the core team of a hardware project. You have to be able to provide a link to publicly available documentation (doesn't have to be perfect, you will learn about that). Exceptionally, we can accept a “one pager” with the project plan, including bill of materials and their availability. You also have to be willing to publish all project details online by the end of the program.
