Dear Open Source Hardware community, friends, enthusiasts and allies,

After a long incubation period, we are very happy to announce that Open Hardware Makers (OHM) is ready to receive its first cohort!

For those of you who are just getting to know about OHM and have no time, here is the "too long didn't read":

 - OHM is a mentorship program for open source hardware projects and their developers. They will learn the best practices that will prepare them to build a reusable, inclusive and sustainable open project. 
 - More information about OHM can be found [here](https://openhardware.space). 
 - The complete Curriculum can be found [here](https://curriculum.openhardware.space). 

For those of you who are just getting to know about OHM and have a little bit more time, here is some more information:

 - The training program runs in cohorts, and each cohort participant project goes through 8 modules, each taking 2 weeks to complete.
 - Each participant project gets matched with a mentor, who supports projects navigating the modules with bi-weekly check-ins. 
 - All projects get to interact with each other in bi-weekly calls, where they discuss challenges, ideas and experiences from the current module they are working on. 
 - Mid-program, a global sprint takes place, so that projects can prepare their documentation for an expert review and a live demo (open to everyone), which takes place by the end of the program. 


If this sounds interesting and if you think your Open Hardware project could benefit from learning about best practices on documentation and being set it up for sustainability, inclusiveness and resusability, than please [apply](https://forms.gle/vpn2FucUozVEcG5dA) to our first cohort! Our group of mentors, experts and community members will be super happy to hear from you!
