Iâ€™m passionate about open science and open source hardware, and how those two can be used to increase research and education reach around the world. I have a background in Neurosciences and have been developing affordable open science hardware and teaching others to do so via workshops, talks and outreach events.

I started [Open Neuroscience](https://open-neuroscience.com), and volunteer at [Trend in Africa](https://trendinafrica.org) as an open source adviser and by organizing and running Open Labware workshops.

Currently I work at the Department of Neurosciences in the University of Sussex, where I develop equipment to support research labs. For more details on those projects check the Open Sussex Neuroscience page.

I am also a member of the [GOSH community](https://forum.openhardware.science/), a network of networks dedicated to making Open Science Hardware Ubiquotous by 2025.
