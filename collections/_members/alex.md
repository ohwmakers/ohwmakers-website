description: STEM-Manager at Oberlab
---

I am a former PhD student of Technical University of Munich, combining microbiology, plant sciences and biochemistry in my research. 

Now I work as STEM-Manager in the federal district of Miesbach near Munich at [Oberlab](https://oberlab.de/). I love 3D printing, recreating scientific instruments and getting lost on unnecessary nerdy projects.
