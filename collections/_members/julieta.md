Hi there! I'm Julieta Arancio, a human born in Buenos Aires, Argentina and currently moving around Geneva, Switzerland. I'm interested in open technologies being used to produce fair and transformative science and technology, both inside and outside academia. As many people working in these topics, I have multiple hats.

As a researcher in Science and Technology Studies, I work at [Fair Tech Collective](fairtechcollective.org/) in the US and [CENIT-UNSAM](www.fund-cenit.org.ar/) in Argentina. During my [PhD](https://github.com/thessaly/phd), which I expect to defend in March 2021, I studied how the Global Open Science Hardware (GOSH) movement contributes to science democratization in the Global South. 

I've recently been awarded an Alfred P. Sloan Foundation grant to pursue a postdoc at Drexel University (PA, US). The project seeks to understand how Open Science Hardware can transform knowledge production in academia, by analyzing a transnational OSH initiative: the Open Flexure microscope, at University of Bath (UK).

As an activist, I'm part of the organization of the Free/Libre technologies network in Latin America for science and education (reGOSH). We connect people and push for open technologies, in particular open hardware, to be adopted in Latin America. As such, I'm particularly interested in policy discussions on open hardware, having represented reGOSH at UNESCO's open science 2020 expert consultation.

I have a background in Environmental Sciences and a love for libre/open source philosophy, which I try to mix in the projects I work on. This led me to work as a consultant in projects linking education, technology and sustainability, some of them with the [Appropedia Foundation](appropedia.org/). If you haven't heard about Appropedia, please check it!

My work at Open Hardware Makers began as a side project and is currently one of the most important things I do. I truly conceive the program as a powerful tool to diversify the open hardware community and welcome more, and more different people from around the world to it.

In case you are curious, I share my thougts on topics that interest me in the [Blog section](https://blog.aranc.io/) of my website. In my free time you can find me playing the flute, cycling, drawing or writing [some poetry](https://thessaly.github.io/palabras/) in Spanish.
