    Open Hardware Makers aims to create a diverse, global community working to enhance the sharing of open hardware. Because of this diversity, it is important to be intentional about providing respectful, equitable spaces — both online and in person — for our community to come together and engage in constructive, respectful discourse. <br> <br>

    Our community guidelines are inspired by those of the Gathering for Open Science Hardware (GOSH) community. They apply to all spaces where the mentorship program is run, both online and in person. Individuals who violate this Code may affect their ability to participate in the program, ranging from temporarily being placed into online moderation to, as a last resort, expulsion from the community or in-person events.<br> <br>
